# Matching pattern
## 1. Nested problem 
Stacks are naturally suited for parsing nested structures due to their LIFO property 
## 2. Monotoic stack
Using `Monotoic stack` maintains the elements in either increasing or decreasing order
## 3. Backtracking support
Stacks facilitate backtracking algorithms by maintaining decision points and allowing efficient state restoration
